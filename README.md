# Group 7 - MATH2020 Coding Competition Submission
This repository contains the submission of Group 7 for the coding competition in the MATH2020 course at VinUniversity. The competition focuses on graph theory, with three distinct tasks aimed at testing our problem-solving and algorithmic skills.

# Tasks Overview
## Task 1: Finding Path in Simple Graphs
Given a grid, potentially containing blocked cells, the goal is to find a valid and shortest path between two given cells A and B.  

## Task 2: Finding Path in Complex Graphs
This task involves a grid with cells assigned weights. The objective is to determine an optimized path from point A to point B, minimizing the expression s + K * c. Here, 's' represents the number of steps from A to B, 'c' is the total weight of the cells along the path, and 'K' is a predefined constant.  

## Task 3: Coloring Vertex and Optimization
(Note: to be updated.)
