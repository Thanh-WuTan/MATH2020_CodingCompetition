**Task Summary:**
In Task 2, the goal is to find the optimal path in a complex graph where each cell in the grid has associated weights. The challenge is to navigate from a starting point (sx, sy) to an ending point (ex, ey) while considering the least number of steps and the least power consumption. The grid may contain blocked cells, and the weights for each cell are dynamic. The task involves implementing Dijkstra's algorithm to find the optimal path and then tracing this path.

**Approach:**

**Dijkstra's Algorithm:**
- **Objective:** Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path in weighted graphs. In this context, it is employed to find the optimal path considering both the least steps and the least power consumption.
  
- **Implementation:**
  - **Initialization:**
    - `distance`: A 2D array to store the minimum distance from the starting point to each cell. Initialized to a large value.
    - `weight`: A 2D array to store the weights of each cell. Cells with weight -2 are considered blocked.
    - `trace`: A 2D array to store the trace of the path.
    
  - **Processing Blocked Cells:**
    - Blocked cells are marked with weight -2.
    
  - **Setting Initial Conditions:**
    - The starting point distance is set to 0.
    - Weights for special cells are set according to the given conditions.
  
  - **Dijkstra's Main Loop:**
    - A priority queue (`heap`) is used to keep track of cells to be explored, prioritized by distance.
    - While the priority queue is not empty, the algorithm explores neighboring cells and updates the distance and trace arrays accordingly.
    - The loop breaks when the ending point is reached.
  - **Code:**
    -   ```python
        # Dijkstra's Algorithm
        heap = [(0, (sx, sy))]

        while heap:
            current_distance, current_cell = hq.heappop(heap)
            
            if current_cell == (ex, ey):
                break
            u, v = current_cell[0], current_cell[1]

            if distance[u][v] < current_distance:
                continue
            for i in range(4):
                x = u + dx[i]
                y = v + dy[i]
                if x < 0 or x >= n or y < 0 or y >= m:  # Out of the boundary
                    continue 
                if weight[x][y] == -2:  # is blocked
                    continue
                w = weight[x][y]
                if w == -1:  # initial, all cells have weight -1, and as default which will have weight j  
                    w = j
                w = k * w + 1  # change the weight to k * w + 1
                if current_distance + w < distance[x][y]:
                    distance[x][y] = current_distance + w
                    trace[x][y] = dd[i]
                    hq.heappush(heap, (current_distance + w, (x, y)))
        ```  
         

**Path Tracing:**
- After Dijkstra's algorithm finds the optimal path, it needs to be traced back from the destination to the starting point.
  
- **Implementation:**
  - A loop iterates, updating the current cell based on the trace and adding it to the path.
  - The loop stops when the starting point is reached or a maximum count of 20 iterations is reached.
  - The resulting path is printed in reverse order along with the total distance traveled.
- **Code:**
    -   ```python
        # Trace the path
        path = []
        u, v = ex, ey
        path.append((u, v))
        cnt = 0
        while True:
            cnt += 1
            if cnt == 21:
                break
            dir = trace[u][v]
            x = u + dx[dir]
            y = v + dy[dir]
            u, v = x, y
            path.append((u, v))
            if (u == sx and v == sy):
                break

        # Output
        print(distance[ex][ey])
        for cell in path[::-1]:
            print(cell[0], cell[1])
        ```

**Reasoning:**
- Dijkstra's algorithm is suitable for this task because it efficiently finds the shortest path in a weighted graph. Considering both the least steps and the least power consumption involves adjusting weights based on specific conditions, which Dijkstra's algorithm can handle effectively.
- The use of a priority queue ensures that cells with lower total weights are explored first, optimizing the search for the optimal path.
- The path tracing mechanism then reconstructs the path from the destination to the starting point. The loop stops after a limited number of iterations to avoid potential infinite loops and for practicality.
